    ``Predict`` inherits from an instance of ``Training``, and consists of
    variables and functions to carry out predictions on new data with the
    previously trained models.

    Some things to be determined:
        1.  Should this class predict a single primary keyset at at time (e.g.,
            a single owner/farm/field_id/year/date) for a given geometry? Or
            should it look for all fields in the field_bounds table for this
            year and try to make predictions on each one?
            To start, just take a single field (it can be switched out for new
            predictions pretty easily).
